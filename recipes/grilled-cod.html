              <li>4 (4 ounce) fillet cod</li>
              <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
              <li>4 pinches garlic powder, or to taste</li>
              <li>1 cup roughly chopped spinach, or to taste</li>
              <li>1 tomato, seeded and diced</li>
              <li>4 tablespoons chopped onion</li>
              <li>4 tablespoons olive oil, or to taste</li>

              <li>4 slices mozzarella cheese, cut into cubes</li>
           </ul>
           <h2>Steps</h2>
           <ol>
              <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat.</li>
              <li>Place cod on a piece of aluminum foil and season 
                with salt, black pepper, and garlic powder. Top cod
                with spinach, tomato, and onion; season again with salt
                and black pepper. Drizzle olive oil and balsamic vinegar
                over cod and top with mozzarella cheese. Fold foil over 
                cod, creating a packet and crimping the edges together 
                to seal.
              </li>
              <li>Cook on the preheated grill until fish flakes easily with a fork
                  7 to 9 minutes.</li>
           </ol>
